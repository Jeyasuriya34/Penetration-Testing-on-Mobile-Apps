# Penetration-Testing-on-Mobile-Apps
The process of assessing a mobile application's security through the simulation of hostile user attacks is known as mobile application penetration testing. By doing this, you can find weaknesses and make sure the application is secure from outside attacks.

1. Preparation
Understand the Application:
Purpose: Understand the app's functionality and its purpose.
Data Flow: Gather information on how data flows from start to end.

Tools and Environment Setup:
Emulators/Simulators: Android Studio
Devices: Genymotion Android Emulator was used. Use real devices for better results
Proxy Tools: Install tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP for intercepting and modifying traffic.
Reverse Engineering Tools: For Android, tools like apktool
Root/Jailbreak Devices: Consider using rooted/jailbroken devices to bypass some security mechanisms and gain deeper access.

2. Static Analysis
Decompile the Application:
Android: Use tools like apktool.

Review the Code:
Look for hardcoded sensitive information (API keys, credentials).
Check for insecure coding practices.
Identify third-party libraries and their security posture.

Configuration Analysis:
Check AndroidManifest.xml (Android) insecure settings.
Ensure proper permissions are requested.

3. Dynamic Analysis
Run the Application:
Proxy Setup: Configure the app to route traffic through your proxy tool.
Traffic Interception: Capture and analyze the network traffic for sensitive data transmission, API endpoints, and potential vulnerabilities like insecure data storage.

Authentication and Authorization:
Test for insecure authentication mechanisms.
Verify that authorization checks are properly enforced.

Input Validation:
Test for injection vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
Validate how the app handles various input types.

Session Management:
Ensure sessions are securely managed.
Check for issues like session fixation or weak session IDs.

4. Advanced Testing
Reverse Engineering:
Analyze the appâ€™s binary for insights into its logic and potential vulnerabilities.
Look for hardcoded keys or algorithms that can be exploited.

Binary Protection Mechanisms:
Test for code obfuscation.
Assess anti-tampering mechanisms.

Local Data Storage:
Analyze how data is stored locally.
Check for sensitive data stored in plain text.

Inter-process Communication:
Evaluate how the app communicates with other apps or processes.

5. Reporting
Document Findings:
Detail each identified vulnerability with a clear description, potential impact.
Provide recommendations for remediation.

Severity Rating:
Rate vulnerabilities based on their severity (e.g., critical, high, medium, low).

Executive Summary:
Summarize the overall security posture of the application.
Highlight critical issues that need immediate attention.

Tools and Resources:
Burp Suite: For intercepting and modifying network traffic.
OWASP ZAP: Another great proxy tool for web and mobile app testing.
Frida: For dynamic instrumentation.
Apktool: For reverse engineering Android apps.
MobSF: Mobile Security Framework for automated static and dynamic analysis.
Wireshark: For capturing network traffic

Best Practices
Regular Updates: Continuously update the app to fix vulnerabilities.
Secure Development Lifecycle: Integrate security testing into the development process.
User Education: Educate users on secure usage practices.
